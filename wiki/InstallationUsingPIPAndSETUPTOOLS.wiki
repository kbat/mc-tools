#How to install/uninstall mc-tools using PIP or SETUPTOOLS.

= Installation/Uninstallation using PIP =
{{{#}}} stands for the prompt for superuser, {{{$}}} that for ordinary user.

== Installation ==
{{{
# pip install http://mc-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk#egg=mc-tools
}}}
== List the installed files ==
{{{
$ pip show -f mc-tools
}}}
== Uninstallation ==
{{{
# pip uninstall mc-tools
}}}

If unfortunately the command above does *NOT* work, you may have to delete all the installed files _manually_...

= Installation/Uninstallation using SETUPTOOLS =
== Installation ==
After downloading the files with subversion and moving to the directory where the files reside, do the following:
{{{
# python setup.py install
}}}

If you wish, you can make a windows installer and install the tools using it;
{{{
$ python setup.py bdist_wininst
}}}
== Location of the installed files ==
All the python files in the package are in an egg directory; e.g.
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mc_tools-r241-py2.7.egg/
for Python 2.7 and mc-tools rev241.

Console scripts such as angel2root are in e.g. /usr/bin.
== Uninstallation ==
I (K.F) _believe_ you can delete the files by the following procedure;
  # remove the console scripts listed in the 'entry_points.txt' file in the egg directory,
  # remove the egg directory itself.
