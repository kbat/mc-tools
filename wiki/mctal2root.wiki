#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

With the *mctal2root* converter, ASCII MCTAL files produced by MCNPX are converted into binary ROOT files containing a set of *[http://root.cern.ch/root/html/THnSparse.html THnSparseF]*, one for each tally.

Many features are supported:

  * all possible binnings
  * macrobodies
  * mesh tallies

Known unsupported features are:

  * `pert` card
  * KCODE calculations
  * (for tests only) NaN values in MCTAL files are correctly exported to ROOT, but tests on these files will fail

== Software requirements==

This software is required for the converter to work:

  # 2.7 <= [http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/ Python] < 3 (Python 2.6 can be used, but the *argparse* module must be installed manually)
  # [http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/downloading-root ROOT Data Analysis Framework ]

This tool provides also the possibility to test the reading and the conversion of MCTAL files. Test routines use the *[http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/software/ndiff/ ndiff]* package.
Developers wishing to improve the code must have this package installed for their tests.
