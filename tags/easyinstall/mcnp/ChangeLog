	  - updated my email address
	  
	  - nbmctal.py:
	  - implemented the use of getNbins function wherever missing
	  - getNbins function modified: the default includeTotalBin
	  is now set to True, because the False option is a specific
	  requirement of the conversion to ROOT format
	  - modified function getTotNumber() to accept the argument
	  includeTotalBin, again set to True by default
	  
	  - nbtestsuite.py, nbmctal2root.py and nbroottestsuite.py:

	  Nicolò Borghi.

2014-01-28 08:32  borghi.nicolo@gmail.com

	* nbmctal/conversiontest, nbmctal/conversiontest.sh,
	  nbmctal/loop_convert, nbmctal/loop_test, nbmctal/nbmctal.py,
	  nbmctal/nbmctal2root.py, nbmctal/nbroottest.py,
	  nbmctal/nbroottestsuite.py, nbmctal/nbtestsuite.py: - ALL FILES:
	  - adjusted colours of output lines
	  
	  - loop_convert, loop_test:
	  - removed unused and already commented sections
	  
	  - nbmctal.py:
	  - added two functions to the class Tally:
	  - getAxis(axisLetter): it returns an array filled with
	  the bin values of the axis requested with the argument
	  axisLetter, which can be chosen among (u,c,e,t) for
	  standard tallies, plus (i,j,k) for mesh tallies
	  - getNbins(axisLetter,includeTotalBin=False): it returns
	  the number of bins of the requested dimension and
	  (includes)excludes the total bin if the argument
	  includeTotalBin is set to (True)False
	  - removed unused debug print lines
	  
	  - nbmctal2root.py:
	  - conditional check: if mesh tally -> 11D, if standard tally ->
	  8D
	  sparse histogram
	  - removed axes contruction (included in nbmctal.py, see above)
	  
	  - nbroottestsuite.py:
	  - diff check repeated with 3 increasing tolerances (only if it
	  fails
	  at the first run). Relative errors of 100% are allowed to account
	  for extremely low powers, like E-46 or E-50. When reached the
	  last
	  step (i.e. 100% error) a warning is issued, but the test succeeds
	  anyway (if files are completely different it will fail even with
	  100% error tolerance).
	  - mesh tally axes cora/b/c are included in the tests
	  - test procedures divided between 8D and 11D sparse histograms
	  - 100% error tolerance and other ndiff-2.00 messages saved to a
	  log
	  file called difflog.txt
	  
	  - conversiontest:
	  - renamed in conversiontest.sh

2014-01-24 11:18  batkov

	* nbmctal/Doxyfile, nbmctal/Makefile: doxygen config added to
	  nbmctal2root

2014-01-21 23:53  borghi.nicolo@gmail.com

	* nbmctal/nbmctal.py, nbmctal/nbmctal2root.py,
	  nbmctal/nbroottestsuite.py, nbmctal/nbtestsuite.py:
	  ***************************************************************
	  *** ATTENTION!!! From the previous commit, the structure of ***
	  *** of mesh tallies has deeply changed and now ***
	  *** it is fully integrated with the previous ***
	  *** routines. ***
	  ***************************************************************
	  
	  - nbmctal.py:
	  - changed 8D data structure to 11D structure for every possible
	  tally (not only mesh).
	  When mesh tallies are not present, the i,j,k indexes are simply
	  set to 1, thus
	  allowing the cross compatibility between 8D and 11D (actually 4D)
	  data. In principle
	  also MCNP6 mesh tallies could turn out to be supported (in e,t
	  bins), but this feature
	  is only an hypothesis
	  - nbmctal2root.py:
	  - mesh tally export capability (dealing with all 11D also for
	  standard tallies)
	  - nbtestsuite.py and nbroottestsuite.py:
	  - support for 11D structures in test procedures
	  
	  *****************************************************************
	  *** ATTENTION!!! Test will fail for cylindrical (and perhaps ***
	  *** also for spherical) mesh tallies ***

	  nbmctal/nbmctal2root.py, nbmctal/nbroottest.py,
	  nbmctal/quick_guide.pdf: - conversiontest:
	  - direct call to nbmctal2root.py and nbroottest.py (not via the
	  Python interpreter)
	  
	  - nbmctal.py:
	  - fixed some verbosity check
	  - check if more vals than expected are found. If this is the
	  case, raise an IO Error
	  
	  - nbmctal2root.py:
	  - first implementation of the conversion of mesh tallies. Should
	  work with all mesh
	  tally types. It will soon change, after a major rewrite of
	  nbmctal.py and test
	  routines for a better and seamless integration with the existing
	  code.
	  
	  - nbroottest.py:
	  - fixed the line to call the Python interpreter
	  
	  - quick_guide.pdf:
	  - Guess what? This is a quick guide!
	  
	  Nicolò Borghi.

	  nbmctal/nbroottest.py, nbmctal/nbroottestsuite.py: - nbmctal.py:
	  - imported math module to use the isnan(float) function
	  - added flag for presence of NaN values
	  - added check for the presence of NaNs, which can be found
	  in tally values or tfc vals
	  
	  - nbmctal2root.py:
	  - warning issued if NaNs are present (overrides verbosity check).
	  NaNs are correctly exported to ROOT anyway.
	  
	  - nbroottest.py:
	  - added check for NaNs flag (set in nbmctal.py). If there are
	  NaNs
	  then the test on the entire file is skipped.
	  
	  - nbroottestsuite.py:
	  - added missing verbosity checks

	  name)
	  - loop_convert:
	  - This is identical to loop_test, but calls the nbmctal2root.py

	* nbmctal/nbmctal.py, nbmctal/nbmctal2root.py: - nbmctal.py:
	  - Minor changes in the format of the information strings printed
	  when the verbose flag is set to True
	  
	  - nbmctal2root.py:
	  - Conversion to ROOT format implemented in a more general way.
	  The previous version was only a draft crafted on a specific
	  5 tally. Now it should be able to work with all the read MCTAL.
	  
	  Nicolò Borghi.

2013-12-09 15:38  borghi.nicolo@gmail.com

	* nbmctal, nbmctal/loop_test, nbmctal/nbmctal.py,
	  nbmctal/nbmctal2root.py, nbmctal/nbmctaltest.py,
	  nbmctal/nbtestsuite.py, nbmctal2root.py: - Deleted
	  nbmctal2root.py
	  - Added folder nbmctal to contain the whole suite of scripts
	  - nbmctal/ contains:
	  - nbmctal.py:
	  - Header and Tally class inherited by the MCTAL class, which is
	  the one
	  to be instantiated in order to read the MCTAL file (use the
	  method Read())
	  - nbtestsuite.py:
	  - FormatStrings is a class that contains all the format rules of
	  the MCTAL
	  files used by MCNPX. These rules are derived from the reference
	  manual and
	  from the source code.
	  - TestSuite is the class to be used to test the correct
	  performance of the
	  Read function in the MCTAL class
	  - nbmctal2root.py:
	  - This is an example of how to interact with the MCTAL class to
	  export MCTAL
	  data in another format
	  - nbmctaltest.py:
	  - This is an example of how to interact both with the MCTAL class
	  and with
	  the TestSuite class
	  - loop_test:
	  - This is and automated bash script for testing several MCTAL
	  files. It returns
	  a simple output whether tests are passed or not.
	  
	  Nicolò Borghi.

2013-12-09 09:16  borghi.nicolo@gmail.com

	* nbmctal2root.py: - Function Read() in the MCTAL class:
	  - added a return self.tallies in order to be able to use the same
	  syntax of other mctal2root versions
	  
	  - Added functions dumpToFile() and loadFile() to the MCTAL class:
	  - These functions are able to store and retrieve the data of the
	  MCTAL instance in a binary file.
	  The purpose of this intermediate file is to have an already
	  processed MCTAL file, easily accessible
	  for conversion to whatever format is needed, without having to
	  read the ASCII file (I think this
	  could be faster than parsing strings...)
	  
	  - MCTAL constructor:
	  - Modified in order to be compatible both with the ASCII
	  procedures and the reading of the binary file
	  
	  Nicolò Borghi.

2013-12-07 21:47  borghi.nicolo@gmail.com

	* nbmctal2root.py: - in function parseTally at line 588:
	  - in the loop I removed the try-catch statement and replaced it
	  with the .isdigit() function
	  
	  Nicolò Borghi.

2013-12-06 21:54  borghi.nicolo@gmail.com

	* nbmctal2root.py: - Fine tuning of the Tally.Read() (and of course
	  Tally.Test()) functions:
	  - an old mcnpx 4c2 mctal file did not contain the particle list
	  for the tally, thus I made the reading of that line optional
	  
	  Nicolò Borghi.

2013-12-06 16:32  borghi.nicolo@gmail.com

	* nbmctal2root.py: - Minor changes in the Tally class just to
	  reflect the requirements imposed
	  by the Read() function in the MCTAL class
	  - MCTAL class completed:
	  - Read function reads correctly all mctals file (at least the
	  ones I tried)
	  except for mesh tallies and similar stuff. So, only "plain" mctal
	  files
	  - Test function implemented. It calls Header.Test() and
	  Tally.Test() functions
	  to write back a test MCTAL file to be compared to the original
	  one for validation.

2013-12-05 14:04  borghi.nicolo@gmail.com

	* nbmctal2root.py: - Main changes at the Tally class:
	  - all the functions get*Number have been removed and replaced
	  with a more
	  straight function getNumbers(index) which takes the letter
	  corresponding
	  the desired axis and returns the number of bin for that
	  particular axis.
	  The main goal of this change is to make this function iterable in
	  a loop
	  cycle or similar.
	  - added flags for storing information about Total or Cumulative
	  binnings.
	  - added the f flag in principle present for cosine, energy and
	  time bins,
	  even if its function is not clear to me.
	  - implemented Test function. It uses the same syntax as in Header
	  class,
	  i.e. Test(filename). The function has been tested for everything
	  apart
	  from values/error and tfc printing, because data will be
	  available after
	  the mctal is read and it is not worth building a dummy set of
	  values.
	  
	  Nicolò Borghi.

2013-12-04 21:10  borghi.nicolo@gmail.com

	* nbmctal2root.py: - First draft of the mctal2root script developed
	  by Nicolò Borghi.
	  - FormatStrings class is meant to retain information about the
	  mcnpx way of formatting the mctal file.
	  It is built from mcnpx manual and mcnpx source code. It should be
	  reliable and general enough.
	  It is used only in Testing procedures
	  - Header class is essentially the same as in mctal.py by KB.
	  Just added the function Test to write the mctal header to a test
	  file for Testing procedures
	  - Tally class merges variables and methods from KB and NB scripts
	  and tries to include all the possible
	  options of each tally. It is based on the mcnpx manual and on the
	  mcnpx source code.
	  The purpose of the large amount of function is just to create a
	  more comfortable (at least for me)
	  interface between user and variables. In the case of the insert
	  functions for cells, cosine, energy,
	  time and tfc, the aim is to be able to avoid exceptions raised by
	  unexpected overflows or such orrible
	  things...
